If you want to have full control over all the form fields on the WP Job Manager submit listing pages, both on the frontend and the admin side, then WP Job Manager Field Editor is the plugin for you. This plugin lets you customize not only the default fields that come with WP Job Manager for submitting job posts, such as job title, location, description, etc., but also create your own custom fields to suit your needs. You can easily change the label of any field, the placeholder text that shows inside the input field, or disable any field that you don't need. WP Job Manager Field Editor also gives you the power to customize how your custom fields are displayed on the frontend, using the Automatic Output feature or the integrated Widget that supports various output types, such as oEmbed, Video, Link, and more.

WP Job Manager Field Editor is very easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. You can drag and drop the fields to reorder them, edit them with a few clicks, or add new ones with a simple form. You can also group your fields into field groups and assign them to specific listing types or categories. This way, you can have different fields for different kinds of jobs.
  
Another great feature of WP Job Manager Field Editor is the conditional logic. You can set up rules to show or hide certain fields based on the values of other fields. For example, you can show a salary field only if the job type is full-time, or hide the company logo field if the company name is not entered. This makes your forms more dynamic and user-friendly.
  
WP Job Manager Field Editor is compatible with most WP Job Manager add-ons, such as Resume Manager, Applications, Job Alerts, Bookmarks, etc. You can also use it with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7, etc. WP Job Manager Field Editor is fully translatable and supports RTL languages. It also has a developer-friendly codebase and hooks for further customization.
